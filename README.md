## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended)

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. Set up the database (see [Database Setup](#database-setup)).

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following variables:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/your-database-name"
```

Replace `user`, `password`, and `your-database-name` with your PostgreSQL credentials.

### Database Setup

1. Ensure PostgreSQL is running.
2. Run Prisma migrations to set up the database schema:

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   ```

3. Seed the database (if applicable):

   ```bash
   npx prisma db seed
   ```

### Running the App
